== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the author box not display on a page? =

The Simple Author Box plugin was designed to display the author information on posts, categories, tags, etc. The plugin does not work on pages – it was not designed for this, unfortunately. Adding the shortcode on a blog page will also not work because the plugin won’t have author information to display/will not know which author information to display. Adding the shortcode in a widget that is on a page is another instance when the SAB will not be displayed due to the same reasons. You can add it in a widget, but that widget has to be on a single post.

= Can I remove the SAB from WooCommerce/Category/Tags pages? Can I have only on posts? =

We are working on a feature for this, but in the meantime we have made a plugin containing a small fix for this.
Please download it from here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gdkumeuilogui6g/wp-sab-fix.zip?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/gdkumeuilogui6g/wp-sab-fix.zip?dl=0</a>
Then go to your dashboard > Plugins > install and activate it and it will solve it.

= I have two author boxes. How can I hide one? =

The second author box might be a theme feature and you will need to turn it off from your theme’s options, or hide it with custom CSS.

= How can I get support? =
